# Snake Game

Snake Game is a classic implementation of the snake game in Python.

## Description

This project is part of my 100 days of code in Python, and it represents my 21st day. 
In this game, players control a snake that must eat food to grow. However, the snake must avoid colliding with the screen edges or its own body.

## Features

- Snake control using **W**, **A**, **S**, and **D** on the keyboard.
- Random generation of food for the snake to eat.
- Snake length increases upon eating food.
- Score tracking to monitor player performance.
- High score tracking reading and writing a .txt file.
- Game over when the snake collides with edges or itself.

## Prerequisites
